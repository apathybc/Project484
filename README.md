# Project484
This goal of this project was to electrify paddles on the pinball machine through the use of solenoids and other components. I did not sucessfully electrify these paddles, but I understand what was necessary to do so. Since I did not sucessfully electrify the paddles, I used the original cardboard paddles that were provided with the pinball machine.
